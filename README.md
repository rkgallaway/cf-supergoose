# Supergoose IS super!
- This package was created as a component to be used with [cf401-api-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cf401-api-server).  It Combines SuperTest and Mongoose Memory Server
 to reduce (hopefully) the pain of
 testing a Mongoose API

cf401-api-server is a basic API server package that allows you to get a functional API-server up and running in as little time as it takes you to install the package.

## About the Package
- This package was created in tandem with the [cf-quick-start package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cf-quick-start), which will help you get your projects set up quickly via the CLI
- Looking to use this to create your own models and routes? We recommend getting started with [cf-quick-start package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cf-quick-start).     - You can also add new models and routes to your repo using just this package, but will need to add symlinks to your files that link to the node_module. The quick-start package handles this for you so you can add routes and models out of the box
- Original supergoose authors: Code Fellows instructors John Cokos and JB Tellez.

## About the creators
This package was created by Ryan Gallaway, Becca Lee, Jared Pattison, and Tanner Seramur as a midterm project for Code Fellows JavaScript 401d28. The source code for the API-Server was created with assistance from their instructor, John Cokos.
